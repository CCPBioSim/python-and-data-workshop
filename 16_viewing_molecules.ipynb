    "[nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html) is an extremely powerful and capable 3D molecule view that runs within a web browser. It supports complex visualisations of molecules from a range of file formats, and can even be used to view trajectories. It provides a full framework for building 3D molecular visualisation into your Jupyter notebooks or websites.\n",

    "While nglview is very powerful, that power and flexibility can be a little daunting for newcomers. [BioSimSpace](https://biosimspace.org) is a project that provides easy-to-use wrappers around common molecular simulation tasks. One such task is viewing molecules. BioSimSpace provides the function `viewMolecules` that uses [nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html) to do exactly that :-)"
