    "[nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/api.html) is an extremely powerful and capable 3D molecule view that runs within a web browser.

It provides a full framework for building 3D molecular visualisation into your Jupyter notebooks or websites.\n",

For example, create a \"point\" representation for water, a \"tube\" representation of the protein and a \"licorice\" representation of all alanine residues. Note - you can control the opacity (level of transparency) of a representation by selecting the representation in the drop down box and changing the \"opacity\" slider in the \"Parameters\" tab - see below.
